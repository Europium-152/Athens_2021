# Objectives for today
Our goal for today is to determine the temperature and density of the plasma inside the langmuir probe experiment.

## Steps to complete the lab

1. Using the template .csv file in the repository, load the data using python
2. Plot the data of pressure, voltage and temperature over time
3. Trim the data to select only a single voltage ramp
4. Plot the current against the voltage. What is the shape?
5. What is the physics equation that models the current vs. voltage characteristic?
6. Fit that equation to the experimental data.
7. Extract the temperature from the fitted parameters.
8. Extract the density from the fitted parameters.
